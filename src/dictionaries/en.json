      "two": "Frequent landslides, triggered by snowmelt, precipitation, and seismic activity, particularly in the Fergana Valley, pose a serious threat to life, infrastructure, and the economy. In response to these challenges, we are implementing the Asian Development Bank's first comprehensive landslide risk reduction project, aimed at protecting rural communities.",
      "three": "The project combines engineering and ecological approaches with community planning and capacity development, applying international experience and advanced technologies for effective monitoring and risk reduction.",
      "four": "The project goals include reducing losses from natural disasters and strengthening the protection of populations and territories for sustainable development, aiming to minimize vulnerability and landslide risk for communities and infrastructure."
